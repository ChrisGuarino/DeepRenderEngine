# Generate dataset

Open data_generator.blend with the command-line: `blender data_generator.blend` and press
`ALT-P` over the text editor (sub-window in Blender with the script). If you get the error
"Python script fail, look in the console for now...", it is because the file wasn't opened
with the command-line.

You can change the parameters used for generation such as data_size and so on.
